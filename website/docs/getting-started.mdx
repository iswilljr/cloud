# Getting Started

Let's discover how to start with the fullstack cloud project

## What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 14 or above:

## Generate the cloud

Get started by creating the **cloud** with the next options

### With Create Home Cloud

Generate the cloud site using the [create home cloud](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-home-cloud) tool.

You can simply start by running the next command:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm init home-cloud@latest
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
yarn create home-cloud
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run the cloud.

See the [documentation](./create-home-cloud) for more information.

### With Repo Cloud Setup

Generate the cloud site using the repo cloud setup.

First clone the repository, by running

```bash
mkdir cloud # or whatever you want to call your directory
cd cloud # or whatever you called your directory
curl https://codeload.github.com/iswilljr/cloud/tar.gz/master | \
tar -xz --strip=2 cloud-master/cloud-setup
```

Setup the cloud running the following commands:

```bash
yarn install:api && cd ..
yarn install:github && cd ..
yarn install:deno && cd ..
```

See the [documentation](./cloud-setup) for more information.

### Manually

You can simply clone the main repo by running:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/iswilljr/cloud
```

Then you can delete the files and directories you don't need. Make sure you install all the dependencies.

## Start your site

Run the server:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
cd cloud/cloud-api # or whatever you called your directories
npm run build
npm run setup
npm start
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
cd cloud/cloud-api # or whatever you called your directories
yarn build
yarn setup
yarn start
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Cloud site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `build` command builds the site. The `setup` command set up the env variables that the server needs. The `start` command starts the server on port 4000.
