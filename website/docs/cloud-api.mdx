### Setup environment variables

Environment variables that are needed:

- `HOME_CLOUD_STORAGE`: The storage path for the home cloud (required)
- `TOKEN`: The token for the github api (required)
  - Generate a token with no scopes [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)

You can create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of your project and set the environment variables there.
or you can set the environment variables just by running the following command and entering the values:

<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm run setup
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
yarn setup
